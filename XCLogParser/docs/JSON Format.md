# XCLogParser JSON Format

A typical step is parsed and output as JSON with the following format:
```json

    "detailStepType" : "swiftCompilation",

The `type` field can assume three different values:
- `main`: the summary of the whole build process. It's usually the Xcode scheme that was built.
- `target`: a target that was built that belongs to a `main` type.
- `detail`: a step inside the target. Usually a script that was run during a Pre build phase, the compilation of a single file inside the target or other Build Rule.

Other fields:
- `buildIdentifier`: a unique identifier for the given build. It uses the machine name plus the IDEActivityLog's unique identifier so it should be unique across different hosts.
- `duration`: duration in seconds for the given step.
- `subSteps`: an array of build steps that belong to the given one.
- `parentIdentifier`: identifier of the step to which the given step belongs to.
- `schema`: the name of the schema that was run.
- `buildStatus`: `succeeded` or `failed`
- `machineName`: the name of the host. If provided, it uses the value of the parameter `machine_name`,  If not, it uses the name returned by `Host.current().localizedName`.
- `signature`: for build steps of type `detail` it has the actual command executed.
- `detailStepType`: only for build steps of type `detail` . It has some info about what was run inside that step.
- `warningCount`: the number of warnings thrown by the compiler for the given step.
- `warnings`: the list of warnings
- `errorCount`: the number of errors for the given step.
- `errors`: the list of errors.
- `swiftFunctionTimes`: Optional. If the step is a `swiftCompilation` and the app was compiled with the flags `-Xfrontend -debug-time-function-bodies` it will show the list of functions and their compilation time. The `occurrences` is the number of times that function is compiled, so the effective time it took in your build is durationMS * ocurrences.
- `swiftTypeCheckTimes`: Optional. If the step is a `swiftCompilation` and the app was compiled with the flags `-debug-time-expression-type-checking` it will show the list of functions and their compilation time. The `occurrences` is the number of times that check happens, so the effective time it took in your buikd is durationMS * ocurrences.
- `fetchedFromCache`: For a `detail` step, `true` indicates that the file wasn't processed nor compiled but fetched from Xcode's internal cache. For a `main` or `target` step, `true` indicates that all its sub steps were fetched from cache, `false` that at least one sub step was proccesed or compiled.
- `compilationEndTimestamp`: Timestamp in which the actual compilation finished. For a Target this could be before `endTimestamp` because in the new Xcode Build System linking can happen way after compilation.
- `compilationDuration` Actual duration in seconds of just the compilation phase. In a Target this could be significant shorter than the `duration`.

When possible, the `signature` content of `detail` steps is parsed to determine its type. This makes it easier to aggregate the data.
